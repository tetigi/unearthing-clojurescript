# Unearthing Clojurescript #

This repo contains the bare minimum required to get started with a Reagent
project in Clojurescript, as described in [this blog post](https://www.toptal.com/clojure/clojurescript-tutorial-react-front-end). Visit https://www.toptal.com/blog and subscribe to our newsletter to read great posts!

## I Just Want To Get My Hands Dirty ##

- Install Leiningen: https://leiningen.org/
- Run `lein figwheel`
- Edit `src/cljs/unearthing-clojurescript/app.cljs` and see the results!

## Places of Note

There aren't many things to actually look at here - getting started with
Clojurescript is simple and doesn't require much set-up!

__project.clj__

Here we have our project definition. This is specific to `leiningen`, which
is a popular Clojure (and Clojurescript) build tool. Most things should be
self-explanatory, especially if you have used something like Gradle before.

__resources/public/index.html__

This describes the binding point for our Reagent application. Our app will
hook into the `div` with the `id=app`. Here we also load in our generated
Javascript (compiled from Clojurescript) and our CSS sheets.

__src/cljs/unearthing-clojurescript/core.cljs__

In our `core.cljs` we have our applications starting point. Here I like
to load our devtools and set up our environment, including binding to
our `index.html`. We pull in our top level `app` module and start up
reagent!

__src/cljs/unearthing-clojurescript/app.cljs__

Finally, we have `app.cljs`, which is where we can start building our
application. I like to split each component into `STYLES`, `STATE` and
`VIEW` for our CSS, state (redux etc.) and component definitions
accordingly, but this is just personal preference!

## Commands

`lein figwheel`       - start the figwheel auto-reloading server

`lein cljsbuild once` - build the whole cljs project

`lein cljsbuild auto` - build the whole cljs and watch for changes
